This is the first sample file being created.
This is done for the testing purposes.
#This thirdline didnt exist earlier but now I am doing it to check if merging is automatically possible or not
Now this is the first time i am editing this file after creating it.
Therefore this is going to be my i guess 4th commit as well.

Now i am going to create a new branch and save this update which is actually my second update for this sample text file.
ANd lets compare the same file between 2 branches. because the main branch will not have this change.
